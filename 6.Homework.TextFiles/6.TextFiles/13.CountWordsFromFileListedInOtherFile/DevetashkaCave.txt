In the beginning of the 1950s, serious explorations of the cave were held, 
the Devetashka cave used to be inhabited (with some interruptions) during 
almost every historical era. The earliest traces of human presence date 
back to the middle of the Early Stone Age before about 70,000 years BC. 
he Devetashka cave is among the cave deposits with the richest cultural 
artifacts from the Neolithic (6th millennium - 4th millennium BC).
The entrance of the cave is 35 meters (115 ft) wide and 30 meters (98 ft) 
high. About 40 meters (130 ft) after the entrance, the cave widens, forming 
a spacious hall with an area of 2,400 square meters (26,000 sq ft). The
 height of the hall is 60 to 100 meters (200 to 330 ft).
About 200 meters (660 ft) from the entrance, the two fields separate from
the hall. The left one is more than 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) long, a small river
runs along it, which passes through the main hall and flows into the Osam
river. The right field is warm and dry. Its entrance is 2.5 meters (8 ft 2 in)
high and 5.7 meters (19 ft) wide. The field widens after the entrance and
forms a rectangular hall – 50 meters (160 ft) long and 10–15 meters
(33–49 ft) wide. This field ends with a small gallery with a round room,
also known as the Altar.
The cave was declared a natural landmark by order No RD 238/ 7 June 1996.
